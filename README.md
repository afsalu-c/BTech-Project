# SWEEBO-FLOOR CLEANING ROBOT
**Final year BTech Degree Project**

This project aims to enhance the cleaning efficiency of robot by handling the litter waste materials like food-containers, plastic bottles etc. within the floor by the help of robotic arm and seggregate the waste materials like biodegradable and non biodegradable to the basin attached to the robot.

## Project Overview

* Built prototyoe model equipped with robotic arm, LiDAR and YOLOv8 based image detection.
* Shortlisted for Centre for Engineering Research and Development (CERD) funding.
* Currently enhancing the robot’s mapping and navigation capabilities using the SLAM Toolbox, the ROS 2 Navigation framework, and sensor fusion.


## Phase 1 Results

1. Data Preprocessing and Standardization
2. GMM-based Synthetic Data Generation
3. Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
4. Model Evaluation using MSE and R² Score
5. SHAP Analysis for Feature Importance
